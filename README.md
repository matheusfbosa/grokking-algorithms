My notes while reading Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava.

## Examples

To run the examples, use the following command:

```sh
make run
```

## Tests

To run the tests and ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms, use the following command:

```sh
make test
```

## Benchmarking

To execute benchmark tests for algorithms that have them and compare their performance, use the following command:

```sh
make bench
```
