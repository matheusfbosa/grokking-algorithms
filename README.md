## Chapters

1. [Introduction to Algorithms](./chapter1)
2. [Selection Sort](./chapter2)
3. [Recursion](./chapter3)
4. [Quicksort](./chapter4)
5. [Hash Tables](./chapter5)
6. [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./chapter6)
7. [Dijkstra's Algorithm](./chapter7)
8. [Greedy Algorithm](./chapter8)

## Examples

To run some [examples](./example.go), please use the following command:

```sh
make run
```

## Tests

To run the tests and ensure the correctness of the implemented algorithms, please use the following command:

```sh
make test
```

## Benchmarking

To execute benchmark tests for algorithms that have them and compare their performance, please use the following command:

```sh
make bench
```
